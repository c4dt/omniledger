                <p>Welcome to the C4DT Demonstrator for the DEDIS blockchain. You've been sent here to claim the user
                    that has been created for you on this blockchain. With this user account you're able to interact
                    with the blockchain and connect to our chat system as well as access restricted content on our
                    webpage.</p>
                <p>To do so, you need to link this browser to your user account. It is important to understand that
                    your account is linked to a browser, so install it on your work computer. Later on you can give
                    access
                    to your user account to other browsers, but this is a more advanced option.</p>
