## Development

While developing the webapp and dynacred, it is sometimes useful to have access to the
source of the cothority-libraries.
To do so, the `tsconfig.common.json` includes a possible replacement of these libraries
with the `cothority` directory in the root.
To start using the `cothority` libraries, and allow debugging changes to them, use:

```bash
make src
```

This will clone and/or upload the `dedis/cothority` repo and install the node-packages for
an easier debugging process.

To get back to the pre-compiled sources, use:

```bash
make npm
```

Please take care that this command will remove all changes you did to the `cothority` repository!
